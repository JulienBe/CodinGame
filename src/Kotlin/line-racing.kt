/**
 * In this game your are a program driving the legendary tron light cycle and fighting against other programs on the game grid.
 *
 * The light cycle moves in straight lines and only turn in 90Â° angles while leaving a solid light ribbon in its wake.
 * Each cycle and associated ribbon features a different color.
 * Should a light cycle stop, hit a light ribbon or goes off the game grid it will be instantly deactivated.
 *
 * The last cycle in play wins the game.
 *
 * Your goal is to be the best program:
 *  once sent to the arena, programs will compete against each-others in battles gathering 2 to 4 cycles.
 *  The more battles you win, the better your rank will be.
